# FL Breaker  
**Federated Learning Breaker: Sybil-Based Data Poisoning Attack Simulator**  

---

## üìù Description  
**FL Breaker** is a simulation tool for Sybil-based untargeted data poisoning attacks in Federated Learning (FL) systems.  

This project was developed for the **NUS Summer Workshop 2025 DADA Class, Group 2**, and is based on the research from the paper:

> [*"Paper Title"*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-031-39828-5_13)  

It also builds upon the implementation from:  
[YunshiuanOAO/Sybil-Based-Data-Poisoning-Attacks-in-Federated-Learning-Poc](https://github.com/YunshiuanOAO/Sybil-Based-Data-Poisoning-Attacks-in-Federated-Learning-Poc)

The tool simulates how malicious actors can use Sybil clients to manipulate FL model updates through data poisoning and gradient amplification.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fl-breaker.git
   cd fl-breaker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > *Requires Python 3.7 or higher.*

---

## üß™ Usage

Run the simulation with customizable parameters:

```bash
python main.py [OPTIONS]
```

### üîß Example Commands

- **Default attack simulation**:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

- **Custom attack with amplified gradients**:
  ```bash
  python main.py --attack-module amplify_attack --amplification-factor 10.0 --rounds 20
  ```

- **Check environment setup only**:
  ```bash
  python main.py --setup-only
  ```

- **Simulate large-scale Sybil attack**:
  ```bash
  python main.py --honest-clients 10 --sybil-clients 5 --num-sybil-per-malicious 128
  ```
